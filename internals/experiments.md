\*INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION\*
# Discord's Experiments
These experiments are documented from **oldest to newest**, so keep that in mind. If any experiment has `N/A` as the description, it means I have no clue what it does. If any experiment has an asterisk at the end, it means it's just something I highly speculate.

## The Actual Experiments
