# Abuse
This folder houses scripts that can abuse every weakness and weird-api-thing I have documented [here](https://github.com/13-05/disc-python-hacks/). Everything in here is for educational purposes and to demonstrate how easily abusable the Discord API is. I do not condone and am not responsible for your actions with these scripts. Oh, and, have fun ;)
