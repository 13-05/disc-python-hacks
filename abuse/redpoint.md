# RedPoint - About
[RedPoint](https://github.com/13-05/redpoint) is a project I started to abuse _every_ weakness in this repository. Note that this is _just a tool_, it's all about how you use it. I'm not responsible with how you choose to use it, blah blah blah, you know that already. Enjoy ;)

###### this file used to be on dsc.red, but that's been archived and redpoint's the better version.
